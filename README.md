## Author's Note

Swifty Ledger is a passion project that is still under development. The main purpose of building this app was to create a versatile tool that helps manage home budgets totally offline, without uploading any vulnerable data to servers owned by third-party companies. 

I use Swifty Ledger every day to manage more than 10 years of historical budget data. The app is performant, although the UI has some minor issues. 

New features are planned to further improve the user experience. Thank you for your support and patience as Swifty Ledger continues to evolve.
